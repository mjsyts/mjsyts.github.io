WHAT'S A VARIABLE FONT ANYWAY? 
Variable fonts are an evolution of the OpenType font specification that enables many different variations of a typeface to be incorporated into a single file, rather than having a separate font file for every width, weight, or style.

OC Pickllle VAR is a variable font with three axes:
  Cutout (COUT)
  Jumble (JMBL)
  Stagger (STGR)

All of the styles of OC Pickllle VAR are contained in the files:
  OCPickllleVARVF.ttf for desktop
and
  OCPickllleVARVF.woff / .woff2 for web

If your app fully supports variable fonts, you can now seamlessly pick intermediate styles that aren’t available as static fonts. Not all apps support variable fonts, and in those cases you can use the static font files. If your software doesn't support the installation of variable fonts install the OTF, WOFF or WOFF2 files found in the STATIC Folder. 



-------------------------------
HOW DO I GET STARTED?
1. Install the font files you want to use

2. Use your app's font picker to view the font family and all the
available styles
