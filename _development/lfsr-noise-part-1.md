## Introduction

<!--
PLACEHOLDER:
Why you care about LFSR noise.
Personal motivation.
Why this sound / technique matters to you.
Keep it short.
-->

---

## What Is an LFSR?

<!--
PLACEHOLDER:
High-level conceptual explanation.
One clear mental model.
No math, no code yet.
-->

<!--
PLACEHOLDER FOR STATIC DIAGRAM OR ANIMATED VISUAL
(Embed or reference will go here later)
-->

---

## The Variant Used in This Post

<!--
PLACEHOLDER:
Exact constraints of this implementation.
Bit width, seed, taps, output behavior.
Explicitly say what is NOT included yet.
-->

---

## Core Algorithm (Step by Step)

<!--
PLACEHOLDER:
Numbered or clearly segmented steps.
Describe the algorithm in plain language.
This should map 1:1 with the visual animation.
-->

## Minimal JavaScript Implementation

<!--
PLACEHOLDER:
Intro sentence framing this as the smallest working core.
-->

```js
// PLACEHOLDER: minimal LFSR implementation
```

<!--
PLACEHOLDER:
Brief explanation of the code.
Why it works.
Why it’s efficient.
-->
