## Musical Expectation

When we listen to music, we are not simply hearing sound. As we listen, we are constantly forming expectations about **how sound should behave in time**. Those expectations operate at multiple levels: physical continuity, harmonic motion, formal progression, even language. When they are denied without being contradicted, the result can feel frustrating.

Nothing is “wrong” here. The irritation arises not from error or novelty, but from denied continuation. This "continuation" is not grounded in any absolute truth, but in familiarity.

## Continuity and Coherence

Musical listening assumes continuity. It is a baseline expectation, and one that only becomes noticeable in its absence. Coherence, however, does not require realism. Once coherence exists, interruptions to it become meaningful.

Electronic music is not constrained by the laws of acoustics. When its behavior is internally consistent, listeners experience it as coherent regardless of its physical implausibility.

A sustained electronic kick drum illustrates this. Although a kick drum cannot sustain acoustically, electronic music can extend its decay without undermining coherence. The violation is temporal, not perceptual.
